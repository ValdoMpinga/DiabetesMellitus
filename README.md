## Diabetes Mellitus is a web app made with django framework, also powered by an AI to predict if a user has diabetes or not


## Project context and motivation


Diabetes is a chronic disease characterized by increased levels of sugar (glucose) in the blood and the inability of our body to transform all the glucose from food, which can be classified into three different types: type 1, type 2 and gestational diabetes. . Without the most appropriate care, these patients can suffer from spikes in their blood sugar levels: either hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.Blood glucose is the amount of sugar we have in our blood. When blood glucose levels increase excessively, it is called hyperglycemia. On the other hand, just the opposite, hypoglycemia occurs when blood glucose levels get too low. Both can have serious consequences, so it is very important for a diabetic to have their blood glucose levels stable.Since 60% of deaths from cardiovascular diseases are linked to diabetes, this project emerged with the aim of improving and safeguarding the daily lives of diabetics, through predictions made by an artificial intelligence model capable of predicting the future state of the patient or in hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia depending on their daily habits, from eating to physical exercise.
